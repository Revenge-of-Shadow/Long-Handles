#Long Handles
A modification for Minecraft 1.16.5 on Forge to add tools associated with long handles.

Was developed for a slowpoke such as myself not comfortable with rapid limited use tools.

#Features
Felling axe and sledgehammer are similar in use: they have extended range and break blocks instantly, albeit have noticeable cooldown between swings.
They deal reasonably big amounts of damage, but using quick-hit standard weapons would be more effective.


##Sledgehammer
Slightly less damage than the axes. Not ideal for digging fast.
Looks menacing.

##Felling ax
Just as slow, slightly more painful to the victim.
Looks menacing.

##Attacks
Not the best choice for sure.
Still, I would prefer this to a pickaxe.

#Undocumented
Obviously associative with long handles are...

##Jo staff
Fast, short Japanese wooden staff.

##Bo staff
Long wooden staff of similar origin.

#Regrets
It would have been immeasurably more useful if it was actually possible to alternate attack range.
Given that this is Minecraft 1.16.5, not only is this hardcoded; the serious problem is that documentation for this version of Minecraft no longer exists. As such, I wasted one damned day trying to make it work.
I was forced to use artificial intelligence to suggest me approaches, but it soon got confused with Minecraft versions and started lying about nonexistent methods.

This was, by far, one of my most obnoxious coding experiences.

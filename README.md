# Long Handles
A modification for Minecraft 1.16.5 on Forge to add tools associated with long handles.

Was developed for a slowpoke such as myself not comfortable with rapid limited use tools.

# Features
Felling axe and sledgehammer are similar in use: they have extended range and break blocks instantly, albeit have noticeable cooldown between swings.
They deal reasonably big amounts of damage, but using quick-hit standard weapons would be more effective.


## Sledgehammer
Slightly less damage than the axes. Not ideal for digging fast.
Looks menacing.

## Felling ax
Just as slow, slightly more painful to the victim.

## Japanese staves
Jo staff - shorter battle staff for quick attacks on good range.
Bo staff - long staff with proportional range.
